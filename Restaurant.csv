"We were at this McDonald's in 2017 & 2019. Due to the fact that it is in T.S. it will always be super crowded and busy. There are 2 in the area but all are super crowded and busy. Nevertheless, the food is great and it comes out in a reasonable time. There is scarce sitting. Don't waste time trying to find a seat, etc. There are jersey barriers outside. Use those.",waste
"We entered and there were several people sleeping at tables with bags of belongings. It was not very clean. We ordered a big breakfast and we were charged for a cup of hot water.",water
"The food there was EXTREMELY overpriced not to mention they had ONE worker on the register AND preparing the food. She was the slowest worker EVER. We literally stood in line for 20 mins. (1person before us). I don’t drink soda/juice so I asked for a cup of water to go with our meals & she gave me a mouthwash cup.",water
"Worst experience ever! First we enter and there’s a lady sitting on the steps that are roped off so you can’t sit upstairs,she mumbles something and points to a sign that they are only taking cash we waited 20 min in line to order and they gave us our food right away but it was awful looked and tasted like it was made hours ago, the bun top was hard and stale and the fries were cold how can the food not be fresh when you have so many ordering? Then there’s this man who wants to wash his hands and they informed him that they were closed he kept gripping that they close the bathrooms at night and that’s wrong and then asked for a cup of water to wash his hands with as we’re going to sit down he’s leaving telling them that there’s water on the floor where he washed his hands because they wouldn’t let him use bathrooms & there’s this huge mess of napkins and water all over the floor but they all just ignored him & made no effort to clean up the mess then we have the privilege of sitting next to 3very drunk girls who kept screaming at the people on the other side of us. I know that somethings are not under control of Mcdonald’s but When you’re open need to be able to maintain standards",water
"It's typically McDonald's and you get exactly what you order, so the food was great. However, having an Auusie accent proved to be sonewhat of a challenge when placing our order. With the loud background noise and asking for a bottle of water, rather than applying the New Yorkan twang warter, we got there in the end.",water
"This is one of the few fast food places still on Times Square so it's very popular and incredibly busy in peak periods. I had to wait in line for 10 minutes to order. But if you don't want to waste 2 hours in a dark restaurant while visiting New York, this is a nice alternative to the usual hot dog stands.\n\nOf course, you can also find larger food carts on some of the streets off Times Square but they seem to operate only during business hours. I did not see any open in the evening.",waste
"McDonalds is what it is. Fast food cheap. Service was fast. Asked to buy a glass of water and was told I had to buy a dasani. Hubby does not like dasani. Asked again and offered to buy a glass of water and was ignored. The iced tea was good as always and the smoothies were cold.",water
"They had a fight between customers at 11pm after Wicked the Musical because one (and older guy who was likely intoxicated) was hollering at a group of young guys and they didn't take it too well. They have security (at McDs?!) who broke it up and threw them out... but seriously at broadway and TSX?",organic
"Okay so you've enjoyed your night out drinking and want to get some carbs in you so you don't feel bad in the morning, DON'T stop at this McDonalds. They closed the restrooms. Where do they expect people to wash there hands before eating. When I spoke to the manager Lisbeth, she stated it was the owners decision. The fries were soggy and the chicken sandwich under cooked. I plan on reporting them to the health department and McDonalds corporate head quarters.",governance
"This place is way too busy and the staff are awful. They don't sell tea!! Which if anyone has ordered tea in the USA knows its just hot water and a teabag on the side which any muppet can do",water
"Found the servers very abrupt and rude, but hay its NY we got used to it, why can't they show their staff how to make a cup of tea, the tea bags goes in before the hot water, you are given a tea bag with your sugar in a bag, which you have to go over to the side to put the tea bag, plus you need to remind them about milk not cream !",water
"We booked this restaurant before we flew to New York, glad we did, on arrival the place was absolutely rammed, very busy which was a good indication for us, we were shown to our table, staff very friendly and polite. I ordered the smoked salmon to start which was delicious, then we all ordered rib eye steak, the steak was so tender and mouth wateringly delicious.\nA must visit when we go back",water
"Had a lovely Saturday morning brunch at Boucherie Union Square. Our reservation was right as they opened and we arrived about 7-8 minutes early - they immediately sat us with menus and bottled water til they finished opening. Service was excellent as was the food and the ambiance. We particularly enjoyed the brioche French toast and bacon. We lingered over multiple cappuccinos enjoying the beautiful interior and the wonderful French bistro music. My son Shazammed several songs to add to his playlist. I would return here in a heartbeat and try their other locations.\n\nThis restaurant takes their job and reputation very seriously. The following is to illustrate the quality of the establishment and their commitment to excellent service. There was a raspberry that was past it's prime on my French toast plate. Just one. It did not affect my enjoyment at all. I just placed it to the side. Since I buy raspberries frequently at home, I KNOW how quickly they start to turn. I just wanted the kitchen to know so they could check their stash of raspberries. I mentioned it to our waitress as she was collecting our plates. She was horrified. She showed the manager who was horrified and marched back to the kitchen. There was an impromptu waitstaff mtg. I received apologies from three different people. They bought us a round of cappuccinos and presented me with a lovely keepsake book which will go on my coffee table at home. The issue in my mind was a nit - their response was absolutely 5-star.\n\nLove this restaurant and hoping to fit in a dinner before we leave!",water
"Open until midnight and true, authentic French. Fine dining with epic service and attention to detail.\n\nI started with the Escargot that came out to bubbly perfection. They were so tender and the hint of lemon was amazing. I used the table bread (which I'm certain was fresh baked that day either in house or by a local vendor (didn't ask)) to scoop them out of their little holes and soak up the garlic lemon sauce they sat in.\n\nNext was the Cesar salad which had more lemon than I am accustomed and I'm completely here for it. After having their I'm definitely upping my lemon game on the one I serve.\n\nFor my main course I have the mussels and pommes frites. I haven't had a good mussel since leaving California in 1999. There was a bit too much of the white wine sauce they come which I found to be wasteful. Each mussel was tender and nearly melted on the tongue, completely delicious. The pommes had an epic crunch that can be difficult to get with something so thin, I was thoroughly impressed. They were a bit too salty at the bottom of the bowl though and I'm not sure if I'd order them again.\n\nBeing a Chef/Baker I definitely didn't want the creme brulee as I make it constantly and find it boring. I'm also not the biggest fan of chocolate, and do my best to not eat American chocolate. The waiter worked with me and suggested a poached pair in a spiced wine reduction with a side of ice cream, I happily agreed. The cinnamon in the wine shined and the warmth of it with the sweet of the pair danced on my tongue. The pear was fork tender so I cut it up into smaller pieces that could be scooped with the spoon to get ice cream there as well. The warmth of the wine and cinnamon, the sweet and warm pear with the cold ice cream was the perfect finish to an amazing meal.\n\nEach course came with a few minutes in between to allow the stomach to start it's job on the previous course. I left satiated but not full because I was given that time between courses.\n\nThis meal was planned because it was close within walking distance of the show I had seen. I'm so glad I napped this out and found Boucherie, it's now added as a favorite in NYC for future trips. LOL glad I come yearly.",waste
"Everything was amazing from apps to dessert. Ibrahim our water was a gem. Steak frites was a true highlight.",water
"Had a lovely evening with my friend at Boucherie. Delicious and generous goat cheese salad, creamed spinach and a burger. Wonderful service - our server, Ibrahim, knew just when to check on us and he and other waitstaff always ensured our water glasses were full. Will definitely go back.",water
"Only perfection Staff was very friendly and kind. Food was mouthwatering I just couldnt stop myself eating. Dear Hüseyin Sezgin done very well job.",water
"A lovely restaurant with great food! The service was slow and we often had to flag down our server when needing water refills and the check. The ambiance was beautiful and there was a large flower display visualized on first entrance that added to the decor nicely. The Croque Madame and coffee was delicious and I would definitely recommend.",water
"Steak Frites was on the Restaurant Week menu at Boucherie but only on the weekdays. Nevertheless when I was there on Sunday, early February, I ate this expensive entrée and savored each and every mouthwatering bite. The large piece of meat topped with Béarnaise sauce was sublime. Shoestring fries were crisp on the outside but over fried on the inside. The servers were friendly and professional. I had no room for dessert.",water
"The steak was so good. I would definitely come back.\nService is excellent.\nServer assistant was awesome, he never let my water glass level down.\n\nFriend (Sonam)of mine like butter and bread which was on the house.\n\nThey should have kept little bit on vegetarian menus , beside that every thing was great.",water
"On arriving they did not have our reservation. Not that it mattered, there were only a sprinkling of diners in the restaurant and 95% of the tables were vacant.\n\nThe receptionist could not find our reservation and she then expected us to squeeze onto a small table, when a table for four would clearly been have been far more comfortable. I told them that the restaurant was not busy, that it was not going to get busy and I saw no reason why I should not take a table for four, which is what we did. The reason for wanting a table for four is that their tables for two were horribly close together. So much so that one of the few other diners, on a nearby table, when he stood up, managed to knock most of the contents of his table onto the floor, with a loud crash.\n\nOur waitress smiled and cheered us up. She is from Moldova. She recommended a Bellini. I asked if it was made with white peach purée, she said it was, I ordered one, it tasted totally wrong. She asked how it was, I said didn’t taste at all right and she was most understanding and offered to remove it straight away. I’m not a Bellini snob ...but best not bother.\n\nA waiter brought sparkling water which was Badoit, that’s good. So many restaurants in NYC sell filtered tap-water which they put in their own bottles and it tastes hideous...and so this was a most pleasant change. Our waitress was so attentive. I had asked the waiter for olive oil and balsamic. He only brought olive oil. Our lovely waitress later asked if we needed more bread and sorted the balsamic.\n\nSaturday is only a limited brunch menu. Had I known that I would have gone somewhere else. I asked our lovely waitress what she recommended.
