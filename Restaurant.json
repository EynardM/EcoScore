Then there’s this man who wants to wash his hands and they informed him that they were closed he kept gripping that they close the bathrooms at night and that’s wrong and then asked for a cup of water to wash his hands with as we’re going to sit down he’s leaving telling them that there’s water on the floor where he washed his hands because they wouldn’t let him use bathrooms & there’s this huge mess of napkins and water all over the floor but they all just ignored him & made no effort to clean up the mess then we have the privilege of sitting next to 3very drunk girls who kept screaming at the people on the other side of us.

Our reservation was right as they opened and we arrived about 7-8 minutes early - they immediately sat us with menus and bottled water til they finished opening. Service was excellent as was the food and the ambiance. We particularly enjoyed the brioche French toast and bacon. We lingered over multiple cappuccinos enjoying the beautiful interior and the wonderful French bistro music. My son Shazammed several songs to add to his playlist. I would return here in a heartbeat and try their other locations.\n\nThis restaurant takes their job and reputation very seriously. The following is to illustrate the quality of the establishment and their commitment to excellent service. There was a raspberry that was past it's prime on my French toast plate. Just one. It did not affect my enjoyment at all. I just placed it to the side. Since I buy raspberries frequently at home, I KNOW how quickly they start to turn. I just wanted the kitchen to know so they could check their stash of raspberries. I mentioned it to our waitress as she was collecting our plates. She was horrified. She showed the manager who was horrified and marched back to the kitchen. There was an impromptu waitstaff mtg. I received apologies from three different people. They bought us a round of cappuccinos and presented me with a lovely keepsake book which will go on my coffee table at home. The issue in my mind was a nit - their response was absolutely 5-star.\n\nLove this restaurant and hoping to fit in a dinner before we leave!",

They were so tender and the hint of lemon was amazing. I used the table bread (which I'm certain was fresh baked that day either in house or by a local vendor (didn't ask)) to scoop them out of their little holes and soak up the garlic lemon sauce they sat in.\n\nNext was the Cesar salad which had more lemon than I am accustomed and I'm completely here for it. After having their I'm definitely upping my lemon game on the one I serve.\n\nFor my main course I have the mussels and pommes frites. I haven't had a good mussel since leaving California in 1999. There was a bit too much of the white wine sauce they come which I found to be wasteful. Each mussel was tender and nearly melted on the tongue, completely delicious. The pommes had an epic crunch that can be difficult to get with something so thin, I was thoroughly impressed. They were a bit too salty at the bottom of the bowl though and I'm not sure if I'd order them again.\n\nBeing a Chef/Baker I definitely didn't want the creme brulee as I make it constantly and find it boring. I'm also not the biggest fan of chocolate, and do my best to not eat American chocolate. The waiter worked with me and suggested a poached pair in a spiced wine reduction with a side of ice cream, I happily agreed. The cinnamon in the wine shined and the warmth of it with the sweet of the pair danced on my tongue. The pear was fork tender so I cut it up into smaller pieces that could be scooped with the spoon to get ice cream there as well. The warmth of the wine and cinnamon, the sweet and warm pear with the cold ice cream was the perfect finish to an amazing meal.\n\nEach course came with a few minutes in between to allow the stomach to start it's job on the previous course. I left satiated but not full because I was given that time between courses.\n\nThis meal was planned because it was close within walking distance of the show I had seen. I'm so glad I napped this out and found Boucherie, it's now added as a favorite in NYC for future trips. LOL glad I come yearly.",

Not that it mattered, there were only a sprinkling of diners in the restaurant and 95% of the tables were vacant.\n\nThe receptionist could not find our reservation and she then expected us to squeeze onto a small table, when a table for four would clearly been have been far more comfortable. I told them that the restaurant was not busy, that it was not going to get busy and I saw no reason why I should not take a table for four, which is what we did. The reason for wanting a table for four is that their tables for two were horribly close together. So much so that one of the few other diners, on a nearby table, when he stood up, managed to knock most of the contents of his table onto the floor, with a loud crash.\n\nOur waitress smiled and cheered us up. She is from Moldova. She recommended a Bellini. I asked if it was made with white peach purée, she said it was, I ordered one, it tasted totally wrong. She asked how it was, I said didn’t taste at all right and she was most understanding and offered to remove it straight away. I’m not a Bellini snob ...but best not bother.\n\nA waiter brought sparkling water which was Badoit, that’s good. So many restaurants in NYC sell filtered tap-water which they put in their own bottles and it tastes hideous...and so this was a most pleasant change. Our waitress was so attentive. I had asked the waiter for olive oil and balsamic. He only brought olive oil. Our lovely waitress later asked if we needed more bread and sorted the balsamic.\n\nSaturday is only a limited brunch menu. Had I known that I would have gone somewhere else. I asked our lovely waitress what she recommended. On the menu was a wagyu truffle burger and a New York strip steak. She recommended the steak without hesitation telling us it was ‘amazing.’\n\nI absolutely loved the music that they were playing throughout. During the week when this place is presumably busy, there is probably a great atmosphere, just not today although it was quite relaxed and saved by the laid back music.\n\nMiss Moldova, our highly attentive waitress, was right about the steak. It was superb. What with our great waitress and the lovely music, it made for an enjoyable visit. Miss Moldova has a name. She’s Catalina...and she has been one of the best waiters we have encountered this visit to NYC. She single handedly turned what would have been an irritating restaurant visit into a lovely ‘brunch.’ Given her efforts, how could I not give this a 5 star rating?\n\nTry to be served by Catalina...and be cheered up. What a really lovely lady. She just beams with goodness and being the lovely person she clearly is.\n\nThe wines by the glass were a huge disappointment. I tried three. Two whites and a rose. Don’t bother. Go for a bottle of something decent.",

We ordered the Wagyu truffle burgers on the recommendation pf our waitress and a side of bacon that arrived 20 minutes and 3 followup later. The burgers were okay but nothing close to spectacular for $44 a piece. The burger came with fries that were not great either. We came in early - at 11:40 am and the place was not full so there was no excuse for the poor service. Well, check came out at $240 plus tip. Seriously overpriced for the quality of the food.

The restaurant is lodged in a very large room with extremely high ceilings, and is attractive, though very noisy. Tables for two are extremely small, causing guests to juggle where to place their water and wine glasses and plates without tipping them . My companion ordered the filet which proved to be quite good. However, my salmon was seriously undercooked and basically raw. I had asked for the salmon to be cooked to a medium level, and with the majority of the fish fairly raw, I could only eat the outside parameters of the salmon. The lentil bed on which the salmon was placed was tasteless and uneatable. However, the chocolate mousse dessert was excellent and I would highly recommend it. Also, the service really saved our evening.Servers were attentive and helpful and went out their way to make our meal pleasant.
