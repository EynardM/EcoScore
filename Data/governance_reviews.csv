"It was clean and that says a lot about SF. No homeless in front this time with their junk in front. The employees at this McDonald's are great for all they put up with on a daily basis. Super service and they should receive hazard pay

"This place is really zero stars ..  I ordered a milk.shake for both my daughters today..one had a dog hair on the rim of the cup,the other had a human hair in th cup 🤢🤢🤮.it smells like urine in the front of the place and inside the entry way but I promised my kids  mc donalds so much so I gave it the benefit of the doubt hoping it would be good..even tho I  did a 360 a few times because of the homeless guy with a pungent urine odor that goes all around the area and they haven't fixed yet.  i  got the shakes for them..but when we got to our destination..it was hair In their shakes..both of them...I'm going on the bbb website tomorrow..they have to be held accountable...my daughter is feeling sick and having stomach issues now.🤬😡😡😡🤬!!!!!!!??????!!!. I only found my youngest daughters reciept",0
Honestly this place is a mess. Wait times are extremely long. Regardless of customer or delivery partner. The employees seem not to understand importance of time efficiency and stand back there laughing and joking when you got 30+ customers waiting inside the store. I avoid this place at all cost. Plus no parking either so either illegally park or walk blocks if you find parking in the neighborhood.,1
"A last resort option for food since it's one of the only places open late night downtown. The homeless have taken over the front of the restaurant and are constantly harassing people for free food or money both inside and outside. The self-serve kiosks which are touch screen, feel filthy to use.
The one bright spot is the staff are amazingly friendly and treat everyone fairly from my experience, however they can get orders wrong so a spot check at pick up is advised.
The food is typical for a Mcdonalds. Nothing special.",2
"I just left the McDonald's on Market Street in San Francisco. I can't believe how terrible the customer service i received here just now. The lady i ordered my food from was so rude and condescending it was wild. I was trying to order a combo meal and i wanted to add on a mocha frappuccino. I have no idea why i was getting so much attitude from her she was also calling me names in her language to her coworkers. I really wish i had gotten her name so i could make a formal complaint to her manager at the restaurant. Anyway, im not going back to that peticular McDonald's location but i love there food too much to not go there anymore.",-1
"No matter what simple item I order, they always get my order wrong, and if I shop online, they consistently neglect to include certain good. I keep going because it's supposed to be affordable and handy, but it's actually turned into the most uncomfortable location.

"I personally am extremely happy that this McDonald's is open at such an hour when all the surrounding establishments are closed. I needed to be on the last Bart out of the city going towards Millbrae in 15 min, I almost passed on going in and ordering, was glad that I didn't because my buy one get one for $1 Chicken and McDouble sandwiches made the ride home great!!!",-1

Almost everywhere I go everyone seems to be very kind and nice to me it all depends how we treat others we always want to give a smile😊😊😊       even though we're going through many problems or issues we still need to keep that smiling cogate smile on our faces. . All the girls at McDonald's they seem to be focused on their job and everyone is very motivated .,-1

"The area outside and near this location is iffy and dirty all the time. And why is a one-time use paper bag $.25? There's no tables to eat in, so you're kinda forced to get a bag unless you want to fumble holding your fries and nuggets. Ridiculous.

"It's a McDonald's in San Francisco. It's always very clean, but otherwise if you've been too any other location you know what to expect here. No seats available though, as a note.

Parking: Zero parking on the sides of this block. Only availability is alleys with paid or short term times.",4
"I go to this McD's kinda alot because it's near where I work. Also because I work nights and it's just about the only place that is open that I am able to get to, order and get back in 30 mins. I use the app so there are 3 days per week that they give a free medium fry with $2 purchase. There's also other deals. They pretty much always have Buy one Big Mac, 1/4er lber, or Chicken Sand & get one more for $.29. Or buy one shake or McFlurry and get a second one for $.29. On top of those deals you get 1000 reward points for every dollar spent. I'm always on a budget so utilizing the deals and rewards, I'm able to get a large soda, medium fry and McDouble for about $5.i know it's not the best food but it's quick and cheap.
There's pretty much always a small group of panhandlers taking turns working the door and a large group of scooter food deliverers. There nowhere to sit there but across the street is a pretty nice public sitting spot but i rarely have time to sit and eat anyway. A few of the workers are really lame to deal with but the two female managers and the really nice guy that bags the food are great. They know me by name and as soon as they see my order they bag it just how i like it to be bagged. In the small handle bag that has a cup holder in it.
Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. The important part to remember is that you should download the app and to yourself. Enjoy",3

"Look folks this place is 99% self service. You walk over to one of the free standing self service screens and simply follow the prompts on the screen. It's primarily picture based so pick a category, make your selection, pick how many you want, add to bag, pay with credit or debit cards is best and the fastest way to get your Happy Meal fix and go. There's always people hanging out front asking for a few bucks. Here's what I do, I offer to buy them a burger, if they except the offer I let them order whatever they want, if they decline the offer I simply say I'm sorry my brother that's the best I can offer you. Nonetheless I'm in and out usually in less than 10 minutes unless it's full.

"Stayed at a hotel right beside this McDonald's so I came here for a quick breakfast, lunch or dinner throughout the week. It's small with only self-serve order kiosks or one cashier behind the half wall. No seating whatsoever so you just grab your order and go. It's clean, the food tastes and looks as it should. Service is always nice and speedy.

However, the city is overrun by the homeless and this McDonald's is no different. The even had one of them inside the entrance asking for food or money and its not a big place. So imagine the smell and the awkwardness so just trying to ignore them. Also, no matter what time of day there's always the same homeless people just outside the McDonald's hanging out or panhandling. As long as you don't interact with them I assume you're fine.",3
"We had to use the kiosk to order but you cannot pay at them. The kiosk said to take the printout of the order to the front to pay but did not print anything.  It took the ""cashier"" 5 minutes to find the order.  The whole thing took much longer than just telling a person our order

Compliment the staff on their tolerance and patience towards the ""ridiculous demand"" to refill their coke",1
"Firstly, this place doesn't have drive through! @Google, please update this!!

Secondly, the service was super slow. My order from the kiosk didn't go through. The service time was so high! There was no one at the cash register for me to order. Lot of homeless people living inside the store. The store itself wasn't clean. I didn't feel safe at all. There was no security guard/employees at the counter. Never gonna come back.",1

Why cant they serve fresh hot french fries?  I stopped by for lunch and got the double and second one for a doller which was nice.   But when I got to my truck to eat the fries were cold.  It was raining and i was not about to go back inside.  I like the mcdonalds fries but only when they are hot.,-1
I greatly pride myself on never giving one star reviews however this place deserves A one star review! This location smells horrible and disgusting. I would not recommend eating at this location. they have close indoor dining for good therefore you have no options to eat and indoors. Are many homeless people asking for money outside the restaurant also inside of the restaurant. Two homeless people were fighting inside of the restaurant. Whenever I go to this location I always walk in holding my Bike Lock. So I can use the Bike Lock as a weapon just in case. This location to some people can be considered a dangerous at night.,0

Great quality food as always from sweetgreen but parking at this location is less than ideal. Service has always been friendly and helpful here as well.

Service was extremely quick.  Good place to hang out watch your favorite sports or chill with friends.  Come check it out.,5
Ordered medium well and well done fries.   Rated one of the best in Orlando and the burger meat is fantastic with American cheese.   Fries are 3/10.   Cook didn't make them well done and the seasoning was not good.   Best burger I had in a while and great bun.,-1
