This is my first time here and Food was awesome. Very friendly staff and LGBT friendly. I ordered a Cali crunch wrap it was kind of spicy but I was warned.
"The food was great, the service was fantastic,  the atmosphere of being co-located with a coffee shop was very cool. The tap beer selection was very nice and there's loads more in cans or bottles too. ‚Ä¶"
This place is definitely in my top 3 vegan restaurants. I ALWAYS get the Buffalo Crunch Wrap with extra buffalo sauce. NEVER disappoints. Every wrap I have gotten from them has been so good! Great food. Great vibes. The staff is great. Not going to stop being a customer any time soon! I appreciate the quality and service!
"Absolutely delicious! Located in a coffee shop. Quick, convenient & clean. We tried a couple different items & they were all delicious! The buffalo crunch being my favorite. I've been back twice since. It sits in your tummy so well. I'm satisfied EVERYtime. Great flavor and the wraps are packed. 10/10 recommend"
First time here -Fresh Flavorful and the right amount of spice! (Cali crunch). Shout out to my girl Hailey! Pleasant experience from the time I got in. Greeted with a warm smile and friendly attitude! Perfect mixture to bring anyone back ‚Ä¶
"Excellent service! They explained the whole food/drink menu making sure we didn‚Äôt miss of any goods. Vegan beer selection.üò± The crunch wrap was very good, and came with a side of chips. We added some queso made out of sweet potato. üòã Very ‚Ä¶"
I had high expectations for this place because  the crunch wraps look extremely delicious but the crunch wraps had no crunch and it kinda lacked flavor. I love the idea that this place serves plant based crunch wraps. I make these vegan ‚Ä¶
My favorite thing about this place is that I can bring my pup in! And that they are all üçÉVEGANüçÉ of course! ‚Ä¶
