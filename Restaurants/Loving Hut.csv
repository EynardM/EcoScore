"I'm a vegan cook myself and we just had the most enjoyable time and the most delishious  creative food there! The dishes we got were utterly amazing! We HIGHLY recommend trying this place! We live an hour away but we will definitely be back!  We had appetizers, dinner, dessert, coffee and hot tea, the works for a very fair price."

"Newbie vegan here (4months committed) & I got to say “ we’ll be back!”   Definitely one of the better spots we’ve come across. Soup was great, the spring roll was too ! We also ordered a few other items (pictured) We’d definitely get again."
"My 3rd time at a Loving Hut, second time at this location. Friendly staff, food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and everything was delicious! Even the non-vegan in our family enjoyed the sushi, dumplings, and garlic tofu dish. Can't wait to come back!"
"Service could have been alot more accommodating and positive. Had never been there before and we were actually celebrating our anniversary. Server sort of put us in a funk and I actually tried to show her some positive vibes,  by the end of our meal I got a smile out of her."
