"The juices are delicious and the sandwiches blow my mind! I don't know how their BLT sandwich is so good. It's not a traditional BLT, as it has lots of additions like pickles, deli meats, cheese, and a special sauce, but WOW it is so good. I often grab this sandwich before going to the airport."
"Vegan juice spot with a whole lot more. This place just celebrated their 7th year anniversary. Small, family owned business that has build a community amongst its guests. The menu is extensive, food, juice, shots, elixirs, etc.. they also …"
This place is a little hole in the wall but the food is excellent and very fresh. The service was fast and friendly. Very clean establishment. They have bench outside and also small tables and chairs. Inside they also have some tables and …
"It's usually pretty good, just pricey is my only complaint. I generally like the food but it's a little crazy how breakfast for 2 can quickly become $50-60. This bite-sized sandwich is like $15. The coffee isn't the best around, but decent enough. The smoothies are really good."
"I recently had the pleasure of trying a veggie sandwich from a local eatery and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. …"
I have only positive things to say about this place. First of all the owner is a total sweetie. The conscious selection of snacks and bites are gem. The smoothies are always smacking and the prices are really reasonable esp for the location. Chefs kiss.
The food and drinks are really well crafted and delicious!  They even sent a hand written note with my food.  How thoughtful.  Found out about them while hunting for vegan food via a food delivery app.   Can’t wait to go visit them for round 2.
The BEST juice spot in LA. I absolutely love it here and it is a MUST! There is also an incredible variety of vegan options. My personal favorite is their Italian Sandwich. The atmosphere is spectacular and the staff is truly what makes …
Considering I’m limited on options trying to find healthy and lower carb options at a good price is kind of tough. Decided to step out of my comfort zone and try this neat salad at this vegan place I found on Google! Best decision I’ve ever …
"That Breakfast Sandwich was one of the best things I have ever eaten.
It almost makes me feel bad for the Breakfast Burrito ... don't get me wrong, it's great. But that Sandwich is on a different level.
This is how you do vegan food."
