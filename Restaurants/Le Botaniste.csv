"I really wanted the food flavors to match the decor of this place. The design is beautiful. Everything looks well thought out from the food display area to the shelving and room decor. Even the food looks delicious, but I found it bland and â€¦"
"WOW WOW WOW ðŸ¤©.

I just canâ€™t put into words! Amazing quality & simplicity. Ooooh, the joy of â€¦"
"This place is wonderful! Our server, Jamal, was helpful and friendly. He offered us suggestions, as it was our first time visiting. The entire menu is vegan. We ordered the Mediterranean Pasta, Tibetan Mama, Omega-3 brownie, and the botanical lemonade. The food is delicious, and the prices are remarkably fair.  We will be back!"
"Calling all herbivores and flavor enthusiasts! If you're on the hunt for a taste bud fiesta, look no further than this vegan haven. I tried their Chilli Sin Carne, and my taste buds threw a partyâ€”they're still talking about it! It's so â€¦"
"Unique set up / sophisticated lunch & dinner room feel to this vegan / plant based NYC restaurant. My partner & I only dine at fully vegan establishments, so when we travel part of the fun is finding places like this to indulge. At Le â€¦"
Iâ€™m so hooked on @le_botaniste since I tried it for the first time! This vegan fast food place has a few locations in the city (please open in the financial district) and is a solid option for plant based food. â€¦
"This is a counter service restaurant. You order the food at the counter and then you get a tray, you then pick out a place to sit and eat. â€¦"
"Le meilleur restaurant dans lequel on ait mangÃ© cette semaine Ã  New-York. La qualitÃ©, le goÃ»t sont au rendez-vous, le lieu est trÃ¨s beau, et ce n'est mÃªme pas cher ! â€¦"
"Stunning vegan spot in Soho.
Tried the vegan chilli and miso soup broth.
Superb. â€¦"
"Great vibe for a weekend brunch or dinner. They have good vegan options. We got the pumpkin soup, Spicy chili sin carne and Pasta. The Spicy chili sin carne is really really good and flavorful. I recommend it. Pasta is okay."
"This was a nice little spot. We had the soup and the summer roll. It is a nice menu and decent vegan food. I wouldnâ€™t say this is the best vegan food weâ€™ve had, vegan can still be beautifully flavoured and balanced. We found the food lacked â€¦"
"DELICIOUS vegan food! Incredible selection and mouth watering chef creations! You must try their avocado slices that are covered in seeds, itâ€™s SO GOOD! Definitely would recommend it, 10/10! Great for vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, allergy conscious, health conscious, delicious food! Even got some yummy fresh pressed juice with my meal!"
"This place is fast, casual, and delicious. Been here a couple times and I believe everything is reported to be 100% organic. This most recent visit I got the pasta bolognese, which was incredibly filling and comforting. Its not going to â€¦"
"This place is one of the all time NY favorites for inexpensive, but super tasty lunch.
The food here tastes homey, is very veggie forward and just plain delicious. â€¦"
"One of my favorite vegetarian restaurants. I visit it every time I travel to NYC. My teen boys who like meat also love this place. Healthy and tasty food tasted like homemade, fresh ingredients and full of flavors. Tibetan Mama and Vegetable Tajine are our favorites. They have several locations in Manhattan."
"We gave Le Botaniste a try because it is a 100% vegan restaurant, perfect for vegans and vegetarians in the city. The Tibetan Mama bowl was great! It was flavorful and diverse in color and texture - the kimchi contrasted delightfully with â€¦"
Beautiful plant based eatery right on 3rd Ave next to Wells Fargo.. got the Tibetan Mama.. ie coconut curry bowl w/ brown rice.. veggies.. and spicy harissa sauce on top.. was flavorful and tasty! Nicely decorated interior.. ideal spot to â€¦
I have recently been diagnosed with a large number of food allergies which has made eating out virtually impossible. Today we discovered Le Botaniste; the staff member taking our order was extremely kind and helpful and knowledgeable. It was nice to have a sense of normalcy in this new world of mine. Thank you!!!
"Happy to find a healthy, budget-friendly option and with beautiful atmosphere and seating spots for lunch in midtown! Highly recommend and will be coming back!"
"Walked in, itâ€™s self-serving so just go up to the counter and order. Itâ€™s not very big but decent size to stop by for lunch or a quick bite. â€¦"
"Great food, love it! Healthy and delicious. Would like if it was slightly less expensive but so good to have great vegan food in the city.  5 starts"
"Grabbed dinner before Lincoln Center.  It is really fast and while there was a nice crowd, we found a table.  The food was delicious and it is great for me to walk into a restaurant knowing I can order anything on the menu. The food was far better than one expects of cafeteria fare and taste easily matches most good restaurants."
"My score for the place is good because the vegan ingredients are so versatile and delicious. I definitely recommend this place for its presentation and taste. I tried spicy chili, it wasn't very spicy. Besides, it was very nutritious. There was chickpeas and lentils in the rice."
"As a non-vegan, I enjoyed this place. Tasty food!
Bottom line: portions could be more generous and/or pricing should be lower. â€¦"
Been here twice. Love the food and vibe here. Recommend it if you are vegan/ vegetarian or just simply want a healthy light meal:)
My favorite to go vegan restaurant. The pasta bolo is the best. The bolognese sauce is too good.
"Can't say enough about this little gem. Grabbed a bite after the opera and before heading to Connecticut.The flavors, presentation, and variety were exceptional for quick fare. Rivals some higher end fare!!! I would head into the city to take a walk and grab lunch here. Just because... It was that good!"
"Been a couple times so far and each time there is something delicious to try. Iâ€™m not vegan, I typically steer away from all vegan restaurantsâ€¦but I keep coming back! â€¦"
"Le Botaniste still surprises the senses as an Upper West Side charm for those looking for (what I think is) the most healthiest of fast casual choices for the area. On display is a cornucopia of vegetables, roots, and spices to craft a â€¦"
First time trying this place in NYC. Really amazing and delicious vegan food and variety! Loved the atmosphere with open windows and outside sitting!
