review
"The food is inconsistent, hit or miss, and overpriced for the portion sizes you get. Placed two orders of steak salad and fish sandwich. The steak itself tasted great but the vegetables sides were paltry and not fresh. The fish sandwich was just horribly dry and tasteless. I’d not try it again."
"The food is very tasty and lots of different vegetables are provided. Highly recommend that if you are looking for something on the healthier side (not processed), that punch a great taste! …"
"Ordered lunch with my office. I wanted the falafel sandwich and was told they don't have that. So I went with the chicken sandwich. Wasn't terrible but won't order again.  The bun was burnt, barely and slaw and the chicken was soggy! Also …"

"Unfortunately the prices have gone up it's $20 almost a plate without even a drink , they only serve half a bread now, small steaks and quality not as good as used and why is it always lukewarm ? when eating inside? also mashed potatoes always cold .  Disappointed with the quality of the food lately ."
"Poor customer service plus cold food is a reflection of poor management. Seasonal vegetables included 3 pieces of zucchini and a random, inedible broccoli stalk. Bread was burnt on one side."
"Featuring Thai salmon salad currently. Light taste, salmon is juicy and perfectly cooked. The almond blueberry cake was sounding promising, it indeed had a rich almond taste; but tasted too artificial and was dry. As a point of critique, …"
