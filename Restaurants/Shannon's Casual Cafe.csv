review
"Shannon has changed ownership , yet most reviews and photos on here , are of the old Shannon and the old menu . I have now been there twice and love it. Prices are very reasonable , menu has a good variety of breakfast , sandwiches and …"
"I would describe Shannon as a no-frills dinner, nothing too fancy and no surprises with the food we ordered. Still found it comforting and a lovely staff that was very friendly."
Great local breakfast spot.  A real locals dinner…you can tell the staff knows most of the customers and they have all been around a while.  Good food at a really good price.
"the old shannons was great. ordered the 2 egg special and was charged ala carte. eggs scrambled very poor, bacon looked microwaved. what a shame. and very poor service. We came it at 8 and were the only guests in the restaurant. Should have known better. Now i know why."
"Food tastes homemade and delicious! Great service in a clean place. Not overpriced. After you order in line first, you fill your own drink around the corner. Then, the waitress brings your order to your table where you chose to sit, etc..."
"I’m always nervous of mom & pop restaurants, but this place is great!  You walk in and feel like you went back in time to a place where everyone is friendly and the food is good.  It’s a counter order and delivery system which is efficient. …"
I had a bacon cheeseburger and fries. The prices are reasonable. The food was just okay. They were a little stingy with the bacon. I will probably stop in again if I'm back in the area and I just happen to be hungry but I'm not gonna drive out of my way and I can't say I would recommend them.
Shannon’s reminded me there are still places I can get a wonderfully filling breakfast for under $10. I ordered 2 pancakes and 2 eggs with cranberry juice. In two more words: Deliciously Satisfying.  Colin the owner was extremely personable …
Simple and elegant. To my delight this place is  a gem in the local small business industry. Greeted immediately by owner with a smile and a wide menu full of lunch and dinner options at an astounding affordable prices. If you want a trip back into time with delicious food and an Irish twist. Shannon’s Casual Cafe is the best choice.
"Came across this place by accident, and I'm impressed by the quality of the food! It was excellent. Ordered pot roast and liver with onion, both were homemade and tasted like it. Would definitely recommend! Kudos to the chef!"
