"On our way from Orlando to California, we caught a morning flight and decided to grab a quick breakfast before boarding. While exploring the airport, we stumbled upon Nature's Table Bistro, which was open and had a bagel with fruits on its …"
Pleasantly greeted by happy staff! Served my breakfast panini and coffee with a smile! Great place for a quick bite before your flight!
"Carnitas Wrap is delicious! (Carnitas, avocado ,corn salsa and beans) Make sure you ask for fresh carnita. Or at least make sure the pan that is being served is relatively fresh."

Nature’s Table is your best option at this terminal at Orlando International Airport. I’m not sure why there are bad reviews as what I ordered was prepared quickly and delicious. I ordered the turkey club and a cup of chili. …
Sooooo grosss!!!! The super food salad is swimming in Mayo. I had to throw it out. The pita that comes with the hummus is so raw and the chocolate chip muffin was insanely dry. Truly a master class in poor food quality. I’m so mad at myself for choosing this place. Try anywhere else.
"First of all Terrible experience. The food was booty, and the service of the “manager” or to be specific THE LADY WITH RED HAIR was terrible. Didn’t want to heat up my sandwich when I know they do, being lazy at her own job smh. Don’t recommend at all! ‘0 stars btw doesn’t let me put 0 star review’"
"Better than reviews lead to expect. The guy taking orders was pleasant and efficient, the guy on till seemed zoned out, the chicken fiesta salad was fine and the hot chocolate scalding hot."
