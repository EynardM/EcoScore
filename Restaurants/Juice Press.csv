review
"Dear Juice Press, I really love you and am not a member of equinox. Unfortunately I work near the area and this is the closest one. You can have my business regularly if only I can use it. …"
"They recently decided to make this location for Equinox members only, even though it is easily accessible by the public through the front door (and its always empty...). A very short-sighted decision, for which they have lost my business!"
run of the mill juice press with plenty of seating. however i have to assume they pay their employees in puke because they are MISERABLE even by nyc food service standards. like i’m depressed enough i don’t come to juice press to feel even more depressed.
They made the only Juice Press in lower Manhattan for Equinox members only. Why??? It is always empty.
This should be removed from Google maps considering it’s not open to the public.  Recommend you just walk down a few blocks to Joe and Juice.  At least they are open to the public.
This location is inside the equinox. Non-members are allowed to use it
Greed.
