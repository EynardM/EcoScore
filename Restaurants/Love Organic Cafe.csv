Absolutely delicious Thai food in this unassuming restaurant in a strip mall. The green curry dumplings blew me away- one of the best green curry sauces I have ever had. The chicken and broccoli was also very tasty. I will definitely return to try other dishes at this excellent restaurant.

"10/10! Sometimes places with menus that try several different cuisines often miss the mark but this place is special! So grateful for this wonderful, healthy cuisine. Dont walk, run here!!!"
"Amazing food, amazing staff, and amazing atmosphere. Food is not only delicious but it’s all vegan and healthy as well. You can close your eyes and blindly pick something on the menu and not be disappointed with your pick. If you love some bomb Thai food (and are vegan) with some great ambiance try this spot out."
"Tacos were phenomenal. Some of the best vegan food I've tried! Homemade lemonade with ginger was also super refreshing and tasted delicious. We were served by Dear, who was really friendly and attentive. Reasonable prices for WeHo. Indoor and outdoor seating available."
