"My fav thing to get especially when I’m on liquids for a few days is their Turkish Lentil Soup, (it’s vegan) they have two out of three vegan soups. it’s consistent and great every time. They just did a reservation and I love it because …"
I was excited to try this place and went out of my way to check it out. This was nothing like it portrays itself to be online. I was expecting super fresh and it was greasy. They barely toasted the bread and  drenched it in butter. They …

Quick and easy place for vegetarian/vegan food! No frills and pretty straight forward. Good simple flavors and decent service too. I got the Falafel Rice Bowl and a Tofu Wrap. Relatively healthy for fast food and hits the spot if you're looking for something different!
"Good prices, food is great but staff is de-coordinated, don’t speak English properly so its hard to place the order. You must choose a salad and all the toppings and dressings before paying for it - you don’t even have a chance to see the …"
