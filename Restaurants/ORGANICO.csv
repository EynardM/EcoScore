review
"Itâ€™s really 4.5 stars. Honestly I was surprised by the flavor of the food. It was fresh, and filling but not heavy. I was very happy with my fried chicken wrap. The custom salad was also full of flavor. Both very delicious and I recommend â€¦"
"Iâ€™ve ordered from here multiple times, and while the prices arenâ€™t cheap you definitely get what you pay for. fresh, high quality ingredients and generous portions. Service is great as well. Even when I order for delivery they leave smiley faces on my ticket :)"
"I love this Organico location (Melrose and Western). It's always consistant, friendly(genuinely) and delicious.  I'm never worried that my food won't be right. I can't say enough good things about this place."
"Super generous portions, high quality, and fast! Love the vegan options and customizability."
Amazingly fresh and creative food options! I ordered on a whim on Uber Eats and was not disappointed. We especially enjoyed the vegetable stir fry.
Last night I had the best paleo bowl Iâ€™ve ever eaten in my life! The ingredients were fresh and scrumptious. I couldnâ€™t believe I was eating something that delicious and healthy. It felt like a dream! I highly recommend Organico!
I order from them twice a week. I really love the custom organic bowls and the bomb breakfast burrito! Ingredients are always fresh. This is my favorite restaurant in the area. A++
There is something addictive about this food. The same ingredients donâ€™t taste as good at other restaurants. And the price is so affordable and portions are huge. They also package Uber eats with care and free snacks!
"Amazing experience and high quality food. Will definitely be coming here frequently in the future, instant fan!"
"A delivery driver came in to pick up an order and the Black lady with the scarf on her head stapling bags together for the delivery drivers was VERY VERY RUDE, LOUD and UNPROFESSIONAL and NEEDS to DO BETTER! People do not spend their hard â€¦"
"Food is not tasty. Me and my girlfriend ordered via Uber eats. 2 different meals quesadilla and ball of organic chicken. Everything is not tasty. Even sauce didnâ€™t helped. I would say this quality of food maximum price is 8$, not 20$. Both of us are disappointed."
"Customer service was excellent!
The food made dance a little. The atmosphere was clean and crisp."
Lots of healthy and vegan options for making your own tacos or bowl.   My tacos were very interesting because of the ingredients I chose.   And reasonably priced.   You can order ahead online.   It was easy.
Iâ€™ve walked by this place a few times & always noticed their open fridge of amazing healthy fun drinks & chips. This time i gave it a try for lunch & was so surprised at how insanely friendly the staff is. I havenâ€™t had this type of service â€¦
amazing food and service! I love the environment of the restaurant. makes it easy for grab and gos but plenty of space to dine in
"I ordered burrito online ðŸŒ¯ and I didnâ€™t know that it has a bacon ðŸ¥“ on it, Iâ€™m Muslim and canâ€™t do eat pork.
I threw it in the trash and wanted make another order but Richard just cooked â€¦"
"So happy to find place that serves fresh, healthy, vegan and non-vegan options made to order, full menu is available late too!"
"Finally trying this new place in Sawtelle. On top of tasting good, my favorite part is the customization so I can easily stick to my diet while adding variety to my meals."
Great place to grab some healthy food. Staff here are so incredibly nice and a great place to sit down and have a meal!
This is my new favorite place. Great value on high quality food. Ive ordered 2x a week
