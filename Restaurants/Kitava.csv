"Great concept and very friendly boss/waiter. The food however was not as good as expected. Chicken bites a little too dry, and the rice/broccoli not warm enough"
Nice ambience but the location is super shady and the food is okay. Service staff are very nice!
"I know of no better healthy meal staple in SF! Fast service + wonderful selection of quality vegetables & proteins, consistently great preparation, generous & satisfying portions, kombucha on tap. Location at 16th & Mission offers convenience, but not scenery. Always worth the trip!"

"TLDR: If you are following any kind of diet or have any allergies, this place is fantastic. If you are not on a diet or allergic to anything, you'll still find something you'll like. …"
Couple vegan options. Great place to dine with non Vegan friends. Food are delicious.
"This place is really good, and definitely one of the best quick lunch/dinner spots in the neighborhood. I really love the israeli options on the menu, and I hope they will bring more in the future. The bowels are very filling, the kombucha …"
"Pros:
The Sweet Plantain bowl was delicious and very satisfying. …"
Ordered takeout with a friend. We each got the power bowl and split an order of the crispy brussel sprouts. …
Delicious and healthy! Please consider preparing and serving all your 'warm' foods hot. It doesn't feel safe to eat by the time it reaches the table.
