"Wish we could have had the dine in, sit down experience at the previous location, but regardless the food was superb. Was our only meal of the day as we were on the move during our stay in NY. Got to meet Chef B and know more about the food ‚Ä¶"

"Small food stop in the village. I highly recommend them. Very lovely girl working the counter and the chef also came to the counter and offered a sample because I wasn‚Äôt sure what to order. The vibes are like family. Good vegan eats, highly recommend the chicken nugget and/or crawfish."

"I recently tried vegan food for the first time, and I'm so glad I chose this place! The experience was amazing, from the delightful flavors to the captivating aroma. The spot is not only very good but also beautifully designed. Highly recommended!"
Seasoned Vegan just does it for me EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!!!!!!! This is such a great restaurant for those that want to eat healthier options. I‚Äôm always so satisfied when I go here! The customer service is beautiful ü•á I‚Äôd recommend the Harlem ‚Ä¶
