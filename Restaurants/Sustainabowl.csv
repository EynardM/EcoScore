"Their pokes are fresh, flavourful and packed with goodness! Dalgona coffee was just as tasty as lovely it looked. Ambience is soothing, service is quick and friendly. 10/10 would visit again"
"You'll find so many delicious urban dining choices up there.
Service is always friendly and welcoming.  And the place calls out to you to stay longer and settle in. …"
"This place is so cute and the staff is very friendly, but honestly my poke bowl was gross. The fish was like mush and I could not really distinguish anything in it, apart from the crunchy garlic. Also it just did not look visually appealing …"

"This is by far the best Poke bowl I’ve EVER had! I had the most popular “Get in my Belly”. Wow, just wow. I did half coconut rice and half greens. They have option to mix the fish to try them all- try e most fresh fish I’ve had. Avocado, …"
The food here is very unique and always delicious! The jackfruit bowl is my favorite so far. The chia pudding (pictured) was also tasty.
"pleasant environment, light dishes and refreshing for a summer day. The plants being part of the environment enchanted me."
Really liked this breakfast place. The croissant with avocado and poached eggs was cooked and made fresh and steaming when it was brought over. The Dragon smoothie was yummy and healthy. A really good start to the day.
"Really amazing, must try! Acai bowls are vibrant and delicious, best bowl I've had for sure, so many fruits and seeds and tastes all in one bowl. Poke bowls are really fantastic too. Very nice people, excellent service."
"The ambience was amazing! Small space but aesthetically designed. Food was tasty, healthy and awesome representation. Loved it.."
