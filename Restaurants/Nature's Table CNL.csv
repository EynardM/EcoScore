review
"My favorite place to eat, is whenever I'm in a bad mood I always order from here and my mood is brightened. The staff is very friendly and the food is excellent."
Friendly and prompt service. Was able to get breakfast sandwiche quickly and it was tasty.
"Fruit was not fresh made me sick, after eating it. Had to call out of work.."
"They went above and beyond on our catering order for an offsite event in Orlando. Vanessa, Elif were so welcoming, patient, nice, knowledgeable and set up our food beautifully. Everything was delicious too! Would give more than 5 stars if possible."
Delicious sandwiches and smoothies in a clean café setting makes every visit a great experience.
"Today I was trying to get an early breakfast, they are supposed to open at 7:30 AM, but in the last two occasions they haven't been ready. …"
This hidden gem was quite a surprise to me when I first came upon it. Clean kitchen and delicious food made to order hot and affordable. Coffee was fresh and hot and the service was friendly and attentive. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and be returning myself frequently.
"I have worked across the street and visited for over 7 years now and since the management, things are not the same. They never have fresh leaf salads anymore, only pasta and raw bro-clii or fruit  and last time I went I was turned off. …"
Delicious breakfast quesadilla! Clean and friendly service for a reasonable price.
"Loved the food, a bit tricky to find but the guy who answer the phone made went out of his way to help me get here! Thank you so much!"
