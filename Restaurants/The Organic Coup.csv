review
"This location for The Organic Coup inside Oracle Park has started using different chicken tenders and they are terrible. I have not had a chance to try the chicken sandwich since the change in meat, however the strips are so bad now I would not recommend them. I also would really like them to bring back garlic tots"
Does one thing and does it great. The chicken wraps and tenders are surprisingly filling and always on point.  Great side items and beverages are also equally good.
My students really liked it! Yummy!
Great game day choice for a giants game!
