review
We had a group of 11 people and the server was great. She was very attentive and did great getting our orders correct. We had 7 bottles of wine which was great. The only thing that wasn’t good was the scallop risotto which had no flavor and seemed like canned veggies. They removed it from the bill which was very nice.
So very greatful.  5-star service received as Peter (manager) was kind and accommodating for our larger than expected party. Our server Samantha was amazing!!! We enjoyed our dining experience and will definitely be back!

"This is a place that I go to EVER TIME I'm in Orlando. Not because of my wine club membership,  but because of the whole package. The staff, food, ambiance...but mostly the wine! The same lady was there for my group tasting that served us …"
"We are members of their wine club in Ohio, so we wanted to do a tasting here.  This is a much bigger place and connected to a convention center.  The bartender for the tasting was very knowledgeable about the grape percentages in the wines and offered good advice on what to try because we like full-bodied red wines."
"I have never had a bad experience at a Cooper's Hawk, regardless of the location. Food is always unbelievably good. Wine is incredible. Service is great. However...I have done probably 20+ wine tastings and have never had a better …"
