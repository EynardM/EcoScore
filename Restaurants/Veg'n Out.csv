review
Really good smoothies. I think I had the chocolate cherry one and enjoyed it outside with my friend. She is allergic to nuts and asked for a smoothie without almond milk. It seemed like there were some options on the menu and the worker made sure to wash his hands and be careful with cross contamination!
Love how the lady making my smoothie knew exactly what I was asking for when I asked to make the Strawberry Shortcake Smoothie Bowl into just a smoothie drink. I think I found a new favorite. I also had the Buffalo Chickpea bowl which was really good. Healthy can be delicious ðŸ˜‰ â€¦
"Lake Nona, FL. If youâ€™re eating healthy or are vegan this place is a reasonable option. I wish they had low calorie dressings for their salads tho. â€¦"
"Had the quinoa bowl. For me, wasnâ€™t very flavorful and didnâ€™t really enjoy it. The Agua Bucha had more flavor! Lol 3 stars because maybe the smoothies and aÃ§aÃ­ bowls are better. $18 for the bowl and drink. Staff was helpful and friendly. Probably wonâ€™t be back"
We were in the area for a soccer tournament and stopped here for lunch. Yum! The salad bowls were great. My only complaint is that I needed more dressing. Next time I'd order an extra one with it. Otherwise they were really good!
"Good food, and didnâ€™t take too long for four people. Itâ€™s nice to see a tasty, healthier and vegan version of the bowls and salads quick service places. FYI there is very limited seating, itâ€™s more take out style. Highly recommend trying it out!"
"Absolutely LOVE coming to Veg'n Out. They have a variety of healthy food options to choose from, like toast, juice, oatmeal, etc. They also have some pretty good Salad & Grain bowls. Besides their salads, the avocado toast is one of my â€¦"
I LOVE VEGâ€™N OUT!! I cannot say that enough!! I want to start by saying if you want your life changed...get the Beet Donâ€™t Kale My Vibe bowl. It was the BEST bowl Iâ€™ve ever had and I canâ€™t wait to get it again. â€¦
We wanted a vegan place for dinner before a flight out of the Orlando airport.  It was great.  The options for our salad or quinoa bowl were amazing.  The coconut bacon was a nice addition to add flavor.
"This Thanksgiving We were blessed  to have enjoyed  an entire Thanksgiving Feast,  prepared with love and made of  plants ,  from Veg'n Out Lake Nona.  When I tell You it was a hit.... The harissa carrots....chef's kiss.  They were prepared â€¦"
