"We went here on a Saturday evening, so it was busy. Friendly waitress and attentive. We were looking for meatless options for fasting (shrimp OK) and were able to find some options. Noodles were OK but needed more flavor. Cocktails were not …"
We got seated at the patio right away no reservation. Service was great.  Everyone was happy with their food. Good drinks as well. Everything at CityWalk is pricey and a long wait. All things considered this was only above average for total money spent for a family of 4 for dinner and we were seated right away. This was a solid spot.

I eat here everytime I go to Universal. It's a great break from the theme park restaurants and the sushi is actually quite good. I wish they had more fresh sushi options on the menu as most items are flash fried. The truffle fries are …
Always an amazing experience at Cowfish in Orlando! Easy to reserve a table using the website. Waiter was very attentive and good at recommending great dishes and beverages. Sushi was on point! The Tropical Storm was a favorite! Always a pleasure and will continue going back to this restaurant.
