review
"I wasn't familiar with The Butcher, and we went there by recommendations. Overall the food was fine, however, this was our most expensive breakfast so far in New York for the outcome. ‚Ä¶"
"The outdoor area is a very sweet brunch place at Bowery. It's pleasant to sit outside, but we were a little uncomfortable with flies and bees because of the flowers. ‚Ä¶"
"The best part of my dining experience was the ambiance. I was seated at a counter in the corner with a great view for people watching. I had a reservation and was seated immediately. The staff was nice enough‚Ä¶no fuss, no muss. They ‚Ä¶"
"Decided to grab breakfast while staying at the Moxy like 2 blocks away, and it did not disappoint! I had The Best Egg sandwich, home fries and a latte from their brunch menu. The sandwich was delicious and the orders came pretty quickly. ‚Ä¶"
"Nice little local serving vegetarian plates.
Got the Crab Cake Benedict egg and the quinoa base is very well-seasoned and flavorful. Egg is cooked a bit over but overall it is fine. ‚Ä¶"
"Great vegan food with great drinks. It's pretty empty for a weekend. There are no lines & no waiting time. Staff are friendly, and the service was quick. Outdoor and in door seating. A little bit expensive for the style of food they are serving but your paying city prices."
"En tant que fran√ßais a New York, nous recommandons cet endroit ! Le service ainsi que la cuisine √©tait de bonne qualit√© et nous √©tions assis en plein soleil en cet apr√®s midi hivernale.‚òÄÔ∏è Nous avions pris des toasts avocat, des burritos et des gaufres üì∏ ‚Ä¶"
Came in randomly escaping random NYC rain pour and sat down to buy a nice latte. I decided that I should get food to eat and I‚Äôm so glad I did. The waiter Ryan helped me choose a delicious latte and a dish off the brunch menu. Everything was perfect. I will be returning. I‚Äôm so happy I found this yummy vegan spot. üå±‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è ‚Ä¶
"Super spot breakfast/brunch v√©g√©tarien. J‚Äôemm√®ne toujours mes amis qui viennent me rendre visite √† NYC ici car il s‚Äôagit d‚Äôune valeur s√ªre, tr√®s bon rapport qualit√©/prix, petit espace ext√©rieur expos√© au soleil, on s‚Äôy sent bien ! Je recommande si vous chercher un spot casual et gourmand"
"It was OK. Wasn‚Äôt the best brunch/breakfast or the worst by any means, it wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice to come here. We got the Egg Sandwich, Country Breakfast and Banana Bread. Went during midweek and not busy at all. Service was quick and great for our experience."
