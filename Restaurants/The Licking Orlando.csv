review
"Food was really good. The greens I had were seasoned well but a little salty to me. I really liked that they used turkey instead of pork. The shrimp and grits were slightly salty too.

"This spot is a solid 3.5. The Licking Orlando was like if Hooters and Red Lobster had a kid, while rap artists sang the lullabies. You have to experience it to be believe it. Servers wore booty shorts that said ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù‚Ä¶not sure why, in terms ‚Ä¶"

"The service and environment were friendly. We were greeted by the staff and ordered in a timely manner. The portions of food were more than enough. One word, SALTY!!! Everything was salty. The flavor was good. I had to peel the crust off the Red  Snapper to eat it. I had the Red Snapper, collard greens, and mac & cheese."
"The parking lot tends to be packed and there is outside seating. The music is pretty loud as if it's a club. Be aware that rap music will play as you eat. I tried chicken wings, sweet potatoes, and greens. The sweet potatoes taste like the ‚Ä¶"
First time here. Wanted some soul food food. Restaurant was clean. Able to get seated quickly. Music was pretty loud but i liked it. The greens was really good with a spicy kick. The shrimp alfredo was good and flavorful. Chicken wings was ‚Ä¶
The place was excellent.  The food was out of this world. They stole someone's big mama and this lady in the kitchen cooking for her life. The only issue I had was the music was to loud. I shall always visit when in Orlando.
