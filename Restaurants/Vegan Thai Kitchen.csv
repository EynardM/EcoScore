"Our new favorite place. They were really nice and their food was so good. We dined in. We had Spicy Eggplant that came with a side of white rice, and Drunken Noodles that I added Tofu and Vegetables to. I am looking forward to trying all their dishes."

The food was of bad quality with lot of oil @ tasted totally unhealthy. I felt nauseous after few minutes of eating. The price was too high for the quantity & the quality of the food and as a special note they add 18% of service tip which …
