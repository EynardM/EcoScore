review
"It says it's VEGAN Restaurant, I went there 11:00 AM they were closed not open, There was Mexican waiting there he said they open in 30 minutes, i said you work here, he said yes so I asked Question is this VEGAN Restaurant he Replied yes â€¦"
Great addition to the East Harlem food scene. Ordered repeatedly and really like it. Nice choice of options.
