"Healthy food oasis in touristy mid-town Manhattan! Thank goodness for Green Symphony: perfect for a shake or juice, salad, sandwhich, soup, or make your own custom bowl from their extremely fresh and tasty hot and cold bar. Their house made …"
"I stopped by Green Symphony to pick up a quick lunch and received very friendly service! I had the chicken curry, turkey meatball, kale and avocado over yellow rice. It was a good portion for $12.50, filling and tasty! I’m really glad I discovered this place and will be back!"
Screwed me over with the toogoodtogo order 2 pickup meals. When I arrived to get my ordered the guy was confused and didn't seem to know they did this. He called his boss and gave me a small plastic container of Lima beans(picture) and 1 …
"Great spot with vegan options in midtown. I had the Seoul bowl and added avocado. A little bit heavy on the rice to veggie ratio - if you give it a good stir it's okay but could definitely use more greens. Dumplings were good and sauce was delicious. Quick, easy, healthy, super reasonably priced even after tip, would definitely go back."
"Mushrooms, spicy noodles, avocado salad, kale salad all were exceptional. Healthy and flavorful. So much better than those franchised salad bars or meals. I really enjoyed my meal. Thank you!"
"My fav go to while working in NYC. Just a few blocks over from the Marriott Marquis and simply delicious! Great vegan options everytime, including their large variety of soup selections. Their juice menu is off the chain - fave are beets me and green monster"
"Delicious natural, non-processed cooking. A variety of beverages and smoothies. Plenty of desserts. fantastic service. Quaint and homey feel. Ending my NYC trip with a visit to this place was just such a good idea."
Bought 2 different vegan sandwiches. And had a smoothie. Food was great! Smoothie hit the spot but it was more juice ratio to smoothie. But everyone has thier preferences. …
Delicious food and great service. I recommend the Turkey meatballs and he-man smoothie!
"This place is fantastic. Fresh, healthy food that leaves one satisfied and nourished. Prices are super reasonable."
The lentil soup is good and yummy. Very tasty. I also like the vegan square energy bar. It’s very filling. They use clean ingredients and is very health conscious. I love that they have vegan and vegetarian options. I have to try their …
"Staff is nice enough, prices are decent, food is mid. Found a Hair in my oatmeal though. I didn't get a receipt so I'm just leaving a review. This sucks cuz I'm really hungry"
"I often stop here for juice, because I'm much too lazy to make it at home. This place ticks a lot of boxes for anyone wanting something healthy:
Good juice combos …"
"I ordered the B12 Tropic Thunder, I was requesting something, fruity and sweet, and was suggested this one.  It had a citrusy tang but with the B vitamins, it did give me a energy boost."
"Filling, wholesome, and tasty foods at reasonable prices. Comfortable casual atmosphere when eating inside the restaurant"
"A GEM. I go well out of my way to come here. The food is delicious, healthy, homegrown, and affordable. And it's just, like, a calming place to be. There are fewer and fewer of these places in the city. Therefore: GEM."
"Question for owner : what bee pollen do you use? Is it NY based?

Do you filter the water used for your drinks?"
"This is the most flavorless food I have ever had. There’s healthy and then there’s just careless. I kid you not, worst meal I’ve ever had in my life."
"I loved this! It’s small, quiet, and has a ton of hot food, smoothies, grab and go options, and snacks. I noticed that the cashier greeted many customers by name— they must have a lot of regulars. …"
"The service here is great, and so is the nut&honey smoothie which I get every day before I go to the YMCA.
They make my smoothie, and if I’m sitting at a table waiting they always hand …"
