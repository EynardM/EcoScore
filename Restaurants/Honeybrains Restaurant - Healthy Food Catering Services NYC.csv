"During my second visit, I enjoyed a delightful meal at this place. The atmosphere is lovely, accompanied by pleasant music, and it's not crowded. Highly recommend. Unfortunately, I was quite hungry and opted for salmon, leaving the potatoes untouched."
"The staff, especially Nick has a very warm and inviting energy. I got the Jerk Salmon brain bowl. It was even better than I expected. The cabbage tasted really good with the salmon. Didn't know cabbage could taste like that. …"

"Had a lovely and generously loaded avocado toast on gluten free bread on a quiet Sunday morning. Simple counter service establishment with uncluttered modernist decor. The oat milk matcha latte was good, too, although I always order it unsweetened so can’t speak to another reviewers comment on it being overly sweet."
