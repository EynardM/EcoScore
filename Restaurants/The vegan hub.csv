review
"Bread was stale, burger barely warm  cheese not melted, fries not fully cooked! Smoothie was barely even cold and doesn't taste good. Nothings tastes good and it wasn't cheap either. Very disappointing. I was starving, so I have to eat it. …"
I cannot believe this is the FOURTH time in the past few months I was delivered a literal Glass Half Full. …
"Wrong order, because of missing items from the establishment and my delivery person from uber eats. My uber eats delivery person did not check to see if they had all the items that I paid for in the uber eats app, and the establishment did …"
Probably one of the worst order experiences I have had. I decided to try this spot because of the options they have. When I received my smoothie is was so hot and nasty. I also ordered the BLT salad and it legit came with just vegan bacon …
I'm completely in love with their vegan chicken tenders. I thought these were actually meat because they taste SO much like chicken. It's incredible! Other menu items are also delicious but I always make sure to have chicken tenders included because omg these taste too amazing to omit.
"Tried ordering from here recently, but I have a severe nut allergy. Staff couldn't even answer the most basic question about which one of their products may or may not have cashews in them. Super disappointed in the service."
I order from them often and have gone in person as well…they have so many vegan options! One of my favorite places to order!
"Phenomenal vegan food 🍱😁😋 I really really love It clean food the best customer service fast I recommend I order there five times a day,, I wouldn’t talk much but everyone should try then they can see how good it’s Yummy ,, Barry ♥️ …"
Horrible!!! They sent me two burnt burgers  no napkins. Very burnt burgers..don't waste your time..they should had never sent a customer burnt food
The young man behind the deli made me a vegan “chop cheese” and it tasted phenomenal. I will continue to support this fantastic business!!!!!!
