First time trying this plant based restaurant and was very pleased! We ordered the BCBS burger and the Guac burger.  They were both made from a black bean base and while the BCBS had vegan cheese on it which was surprisingly delicious I am ‚Ä¶
My brother and I both enjoyed Beatnic this weekend. I particularly loved the Chicky Deluxe although it was a HARD decision as almost everything sounded amazing. I also loved how they had air fried french fries. Their ketchup was actually ‚Ä¶
"Decent fast food vegan spot. Prices are reasonable and it‚Äôs in the mix of things. Highlights were the truffle melt and tomato soup. We also ordered the crispy chicky salad (which came without dressing), sweet potato fries (which weren‚Äôt ‚Ä¶"
"The food was alright. If you're in the area and looking for vegan food, it's a fine place. I wouldn't travel or make plans for the sole purpose of eating here. The salads could be made more substantial because it felt as if the listed salad ‚Ä¶"
"I had take out from this Rockefeller restaurant. Perfect avocado ü•ë , quinoa, and super fresh lettuce and crunchy chips.  You can order extra dressing as needed‚Ä¶ Definitely add a protein ‚Ä¶"
"Loved this place when we visited NYC so this was the 2nd one we visited. Food was a little cold though, and this was the 2nd time we asked for no jalapeno and the 2nd time we were ignored, so not sure if it's normal to customise your order here or frowned upon. Try the chilli fries! üòç ‚Ä¶"
"Great looking place, clean and bright.  Customer service is friendly and inviting.  Food is amazing, as a vegan hard to find places that are vegan, healthy and taste great, the Beatnic is the place.  Whether you are vegan or not you will enjoy this place.  I will certainly come again when I‚Äôm in NYC!"

Over hyped over priced vegan food with terrible service. I ordered a burger from here and it was a mess. The sauce was leaking all over the container outside of the burger. You can see this was poorly prepared and the buns are very moist ‚Ä¶
I ate here twice while in NYC and had the Fable Chili Burrito both times. The portions were good and the flavor was amazing. My only ding is that the rice in the second wrap was crunchy and undercooked.
