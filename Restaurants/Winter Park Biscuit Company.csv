Truly amazing food. I had the death valley chicken sandwich and kale salad and am in LOVE. It is such incredibly tasty food. I never thought I could enjoy a kale salad so much and the chicken sandwich was the perfect level of spice. Truly a vegan gem and I can’t wait to come back next time I visit orlando.
The biscuits are obviously amazing and for the most part the food is good. Some items need a bit more seasoning than others but still worth a try. I'd say top 3 best vegan spot in Central Florida. Try the loaded fries.
One of my favorite places to go and bring out of town friends too. The breaded vegan chicken here is absolutely incredible. They have breakfast options all day and have the best kale Caesar I’ve ever had. I also love that they have a chickpea salad if you’re not into faux meat. Be sure to get the maple mustard for dipping!

Amazing food! One of the best vegan options in Orlando. That Gator Sauce!!! Even the fries are fire. Been here a few times before this review. Usually going with the tenders tossed in Gator Sauce. Great customer service and staff as well.
"The food here is sooooo friggin good. Would recommend to try some kind of chicken and some kind of biscuit from the menu. Also really love that spicy gator sauce! The service was good, too! We waited in line to order but it moved fast."
Such amazing flavors. The crunch on the chickn is always satisfying. The customer service is outstanding!
