review
Ordered 6 tacos for me and my sister and they were amazing. Had one of each and they hit the spot as we were near the hospital looking for good food and only found bars and Cafes. Thank you to who spoke with us super happy and kinda and made our food quick ðŸ™‚. â€¦
Highly recommend!!! The owner is very nice! My fav are La Suzette and Strawberry Cheesecake! Itâ€™s my first time to try salty crepe and I love it!
I loved my experience at crepes la suzette! this was my first time having a savory crepe. I got the Caprese with chicken and my partner had the La Suzette (their signature crepe). I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious and flavorful â€¦
"I tried these amazing crepÃ©s a few weeks ago and I fell in love! Super tasty !! I love theeeeem so much, I swear I could eat like 4 jaja super delicious and the owner is so kind and gave us a great customer service. â€¦"
"I love this place!! All of the options are delicious, the owner is super friendly and the place is pet friendly! I can finally say that I found a perfect spot for crepes!"
"the food is very good, the sweet crepes wow!  you have to try this place!"
Really good Crepes! Try the Cocoa Blast itâ€™s really DELICIOUS!!
Iâ€™ve been meaning to stop by this spot ever since I saw it and I finally did. Had the classic burger as it comes. Tasted phenomenal and the portion was good. Fries were also on point. Definitely coming back to try something else on the menu.
"The best crepes in Orlando!  I've already tried them all, and they're really deliciousðŸ˜» I just need to try vegan capresse, I'll go for it soon, thanks for the excellent service. â€¦"
"If you havenâ€™t tried these crepes, youâ€™re honestly missing out. Best spot to grab either a salty or sweet crepe in Ivanhoe Village! 100% recommended."
