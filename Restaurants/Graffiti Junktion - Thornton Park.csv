"Absolutely THE BEST wings we have ever had.  They were seasoned well, cooked perfectly, and had a perfect amount of sauce.   The fires were tasty and well cooked.  The service was quick and friendly.  I honestly cannot believe how good the wings were.  Seriously. Try the wings."
The restaurant wasn't busy. The server forgot things too frequently. My burger was not cooked the way I wanted. Got charged for a side of sauce even with the terrible service. Only good thing was the atmosphere. Would only come back for a beer and the game.

"The food was good. The staff was excellent. Parking can be tricky, but what do you expect it's DT Orlando.  There is a  parking garage behind the 7-11 located just across the street.  Wing sauce was my 2nd favorite behind the zucchini fries!"
Came here for the first time.  Have to say the American burger with fries was great.  Place has plenty of seating area indoors and out.  Has plenty of TVs for the sports enthusiasts.  Service was extremely quick.  Good place to hang out watch your favorite sports or chill with friends.  Come check it out.
Ordered medium well and well done fries.   Rated one of the best in Orlando and the burger meat is fantastic with American cheese.   Fries are 3/10.   Cook didn't make them well done and the seasoning was not good.   Best burger I had in a while and great bun.
