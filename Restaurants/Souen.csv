review
The food is tasty but appearance and plating could be improved. Many of the meal plates are very brown/green and could be improved with fresh garnish. Sliced scallions or green onion would add a lot.
"Souen is such a cool, historic NYC restaurant with really down to earth food that makes you feel good after eating it. I ordered the macro platter, edamame guacamole, tempeh fritters, the coconut mousse along with the blueberry mousse. All â€¦"
Easily the best vegan oriented spot I've ever dined at. I generally despise vegan cuisine but this spot stood out from the crowd. Extremely healthy and delicious fare. The sweet potato fry sauce was insane. I hIghly recommend the pesto and the cashew alfredo pasta.
"The best vegan curry shoyu ramen Iâ€™ve ever had in my life. The vegetable dumplings and summer rolls are to die for! Everything tastes so fresh, healthy, and delicious. This is one of my all time favorite restaurants. Every time we are in NYC we come here at least twice. Highly recommend this place!"
Holy moly. I have been a few times and it is always great. This time was exceptional I tried the black sesame vegan ramen. Wooow. So lucky to be able to try out new foods. Service was great! Really nice energy and cute environment! Will be back to eat more often now!!!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥sooo good. â€¦
"Iâ€™m obsessed with Souen. Every part of eating their food gives you the feeling that you are loved and that you are nourishing your body by giving it such nutritious, thoughtful, and balanced meals! Thank you so much to all the wonderful, â€¦"
"I've been to this restaurant twice now, and both times I've received great food and great service. I think the miso soup is great. The squash that comes will have you wanting to eat squash on a regular basis. The miso soup is officially â€¦"
"I loved the food here. Space was tight, but it is Manhattan, right? My friend got the macro plate which looked super filling and healthy, we got some yuba wrapped in tofu skin to share, and I got the curry ramen with soba noodles. â€¦"
"Amazing (mostly) vegan place!! (Everything is vegan except for some fish meals). Very healthy food, no added sugars or whatnot, and the deserts are amazing and as healthy as desert can get! Just be aware that some meals might be spicy. Definitely recommend!!"
"So fresh, so fine! Love the food - my favorite place for wholesome vegan ramen! Tahini Miso is the way to go woop woop! Thanks for this lovely place ðŸŒžðŸŒž â€¦"
