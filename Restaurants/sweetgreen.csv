review
"Three orders placed on their app arrived with the container or bag being partially open or no tape securing the items. Today the order didn't arrive at all.  I keep receiving emails about their high customer service standards....clearly there are none.  I'm done, you have your credits back!"
"Love SG, but this location sucks. See other reviews / 100% agree to not order after 7:30/8pm. My tofu is like rocks. ‚Ä¶"
I was in Hollywood and wanted to eat something friendly to the diet I've been eating lately. Sweet Green is a place I've enjoyed before so I stopped here. I had a Hot Chicken Plate. It was tasty and healthy.
I eat here all the time and love sweet greens but do not order after 8pm - the blackened chicken in my salad is literally so hard it does not even feel like food. Super disappointing as I ordered at 8:20 so the restaurant was still open for ‚Ä¶
"Love sweet green! Today Lauren put together my order it was so delicious. she was super kind and had great customer service skills. there was a million things going on and she was very cool, calm, and collected. I will def. return. (also shout out to her mgr. Damaris)"
"Great salads and bowls, nice space to sit in, most of the ingredients are locally sourced from small producers. It's fresh and healthy with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. If you end up building your own, beware that it will ‚Ä¶"
"Modern, comfortable vibe, super fresh ingredients, killer dressings and very pleasant personnel.  Add indoor and outdoor seating with views of the foot and high end car traffic on Sunset and you have a place worth your time. ‚Ä¶"
"Staff here is super friendly and awesome, they make you feel right at home. There are tons of topping options and the salads are made with love. Always fresh food, and it usually lasts me two meals. One of my favorite lunch spots!"
First time eating here and it lived up to all the hype! Absolutely incredible. Love that everything is local and organic too. It was also really awesome to see that they had composting but disappointing to see that there was no recycling. ‚Ä¶
I had the harvest bowl with grilled mushrooms and it was stunning! Never know salad can be this satisfying!
Appreciate healthy options. Sweat potatoes somewhat small portion for $4.50. Great dip it comes with. Arugula salad was good. Dressings good. Chicken color unique. I like the crunch. Lunch vibe. I‚Äôm not overly excited about it. I‚Äôd recommend for the vegan/vegetarian/healthy eating option lunch. Saw a few salad options I‚Äôd pick.
I love Sweetgreen‚Äôs Harvest salad so much it helps keep me alive!! I have to switch spinach for kale and it‚Äôs the best!  They are doing a great job at the salads.  It‚Äôs such a good option for people with food allergies like me.  I love that ‚Ä¶
We couldn‚Äôt wait for it to open up !  The food is delicious and healthy.  They have top notch food that you can order really easily.  The staff is friendly and help you through your order - which is really helpful and easy . ‚Ä¶
I have ordered from this location twice and both times have not been great. I was hoping the first time was a fluke but I am realizing this is consistent for this location. I order ahead each time so that they have enough time to finish my ‚Ä¶
Don‚Äôt come here unless you want terrible service and no change. The black lady working and the woman making salads today around 11:20am no considerate didnt acknowledge any customers and was even giving the lady in front of me a hard time ‚Ä¶
I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Salad and got neither hot sauce nor chicken. I just involuntarily ate the healthiest salad of my life. I did not ask for this. My buddy did not get his focaccia bread or hummus - which we paid extra for. I don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶
"On two separate occasions, this location has completely forgotten to put the meat in my salad. It‚Äôs pretty hard to forget the main ingredient in a dish, so I can only assume that they don‚Äôt do any sort of double checking which is annoying. ‚Ä¶"
"Less food,  more sweet potatoes.
This seems to be healthy food restaurant, is located off 8th street,  in a very historical area.   The parking is certainly not cheap and hard to find,  so you ‚Ä¶"
"The service and staff was great.
They have been trained well.
The food is good. They tend to run out of stuff an hour or so before closing. ‚Ä¶"
"Green Goddess Bowl üòç w/ blackened chicken

So fresh and delicious. Fairly priced and decent sizing.
The customer service was amazing as well, friendly and greeted with smiles. ‚Ä¶"
"Ordered on Uber a hot honey chicken plate and the chicken smells and IS RAW. Insides are red
So sad because I order from SG a lot but For sure not ordering from this location again. :("
"I‚Äôve never been disappointed here, affable staff, regular variety of new items. What else do you need when getting your roughage on city slickers. Eat and commiserate on the outdoor seating watching all kind of people and cars on LaBrea. ‚Ä¶"
"Nice and clean space, fast service.
Not very polite staff.
Salads are good, nothing crazy. You get a decent healthy and quick meal."
Another cool sg spot in La Brea. Their menus are a bit different to stores in NY. ‚Ä¶
Feels like I‚Äôm over paying $16 for a bowl of salad. I asked for the chicken and Brussels sprouts. Let me know when you spot the chicken. Sweetgreen makes me like salad but they really skimp on portions.
Friendly staff. I love ordering with the app. It's very easy and fast. The new chipotle pepper bowl is delicious. I like the spicy salsa.
Great quality food as always from sweetgreen but parking at this location is less than ideal. Service has always been friendly and helpful here as well. I recommend going with the Chicken Pesto Parm bowl. I substitute kale instead of spinach and also do blackened chicken instead of normal chicken (more flavor). Enjoy!
"OMG!! Sweetgreens is my life. I don‚Äôt live close enough to go often, but every time I‚Äôm in the area and I mean ‚ÄúEVERY TIME‚Äù I will stop and grab me a ‚ÄúShroomami‚Äù salad üî•üî•üî• ‚Ä¶"
"Pricey, but for a good reason. Most of the ingredients used to make orders are sourced locally. They even have a list of farmers and other growers they work with. Very good and very recommended."
"Ordered delivery of a salad for which the main ingredient was arugula. Salad arrived with no arugula or any greens whatsoever - only toppings. I was not notified of the missing ingredient or given a chance to cancel my order or swap the ingredient, and I was rejected after requesting a refund."
"I enjoy the shroomami warm bowl from Sweetgreen. I typically add blackened chicken for additional protein. Today, I was a couple of bites into my bowl when I realized there was absolutely no chicken. Mind you this is during my 30 minute ‚Ä¶"
"So fresh! I love their food, I have tried a few salads and rice bowls and everything has been delicious. Establishment is well kept and clean. Portions and prices are reasonable."
I ordered Harvest Bowl from Uber eats and this is what i got. It‚Äôs a kale salad and they forgot to put kale. This is what i got for my time and money.
"Clean and nice place with delicious healthy food options. The prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly and accommodating! Great experience. :)"
Found a hair in my salad. So disgusting! The staff at this location are always rushing and not very cleanly. They‚Äôre also always out of stock in items. Very upset about the hair in my salad today. Won‚Äôt be ordering from here again. So GROSS!
I really loved this place at first when they first opened. But as I ate through most of my salad (Mind you I had consistently bought many salads here). I found a lady bug in it. They did apologize and refunded my money. I guess it shows how ‚Ä¶
"High-quality options and deliciously paired flavors. Staff was very accommodating, too."
"I‚Äôm not complaining on the food! No parking and then after i got the food no utensils and no napkins. It‚Äôs a pickup order, everything should be ready! Bad management"
Really enjoyed my summer salad with elote and all the greens you could want. It's a bit pricey but in the middle of downtown and with the quality you get I didn't feel it was an issue. ‚Ä¶
(I'm posting this about 4 months after the fact but...) I went here in between biz meetings and Rich (I still remember his name -- THAT'S how awesome he is!) was working the line each time I went. He was super friendly and the salads were amazing. The rest of the staff was very attentive too and the place was clean. Loved it!
I eat healthy and I was really excited when we got a new restaurant and to the neighborhood. But that excitement quickly faded after looking at the menu and the prices are outrageous! For a basic iceberg salad you're gonna pay between ‚Ä¶
This is the third or fourth time we have ordered from this particular Sweetgreen and every time they have messed up our order. Ordered and paid for chicken on a salad but didn‚Äôt come on the salad. No number to call where anyone answers. No ‚Ä¶
Oh my GOODNESS this food is AMAZING. I have no complaints! I ordered the miso bowl‚Ä¶. So BOMB. I added the portobello mushrooms üò©üëåüèΩ I cannot rave enough. It‚Äôs too good. ‚Ä¶
I absolutely love this chain. The salads are amazing!! This specific location had a slight problem with the trash over-flowing but they seemed to be very busy and an employee came to clean it up as we left.
My chicken pesto bowl had a long HAIR in it. Nothing like taking a big bite of spinach with a side of follicle. Avoiding this location at all costs.
The food is delicious but the wait is unreasonable.  They have 8 people working at the restaurant but only one person making salads for people in line.  That same person is also checking everyone out. This place needs to better allocate staff.
The best staff I have met anywhere in any branch <3 the way they do business and the customer service and the cleanliness. Highly recommended and what a team you got !! They deserve a tip jar or a raise or something to reflect the love they put in.
"I ordered with Uber today, and the order wasn't properly packaged. Both bowl lids were loose, and the food was exposed. This has happened twice in a row, and it's extremely disappointing. I ordered my usual bowl but received only a third of the portion. It's terrible. I will cancel my Sweetgreen membership and won't renew it."
"Their salads are delicious! My friend had the hot bowl and I had the chicken pesto, they were both insanely tasty. I even put it in the fridge to finish later and it held wonderfully. The people there were helpful in making sure I got what I wanted. Oh yeah, get the rosemary focaccia bread, it's amazing!"
Aubriana helped me today and literally so amazing cannot express how sweet and helpful she was. She totally made my day! Who woulda thought a visit sweetgreen would‚Äôve been so dearü©∑ü•π ‚Ä¶
placed an order with Uber eats for Chicken Pesto Parm and Buffalo Chicken Salad.  Less than 1 oz of chicken on each salad.  So disappointing. This is the second time I've had poor portions from Sweetgreens.  You've lost a customer.  Attaching pictures and please do not mistake the croutons for cold chicken.
"I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the service my wife and I received during our recent visit to your Sweetgreen branch located at 171 2nd St, San Francisco, CA 94105. Our experience was not only disappointing but also ‚Ä¶"
"as it‚Äôs just down the street from where I‚Äôm staying I decided to check it out

ordered one of their southwest chicken fajita protein plates as it was hero‚Äôd ‚Ä¶"
Really great experience. Ordered online. Was ready on time. Perfectly prepared. And it was so high quality and delicious. Got the buffalo chicken salad and definitely recommend.
"During this period I was able to try the honey chicken and the BBQ Chicken + Squash plate. The only real difference I found was the sauce provided, otherwise give off the same vibe‚Äîlots of chicken, clean, and filling. All you can ask for!"
The kale-Ceasar salad is awesome. If you‚Äôre ok to pay a bit extra and just want a large salad with top quality ingredients - I would recommend this place.
"Family lunch, 2 adults+2 kids. Ordered 3 salads, so we could split one of them among the 2 kids. We were offered an extra container to help split the food. We were offered a complimentary bowl with some fruit for the kids. Nice detail! ‚Ä¶"
"The salad was very fresh and delicious. I am a vegan and I was very impressed with the vegan options they had.  I asked for honey mustard dressing, but I'm certain what I got was not honey mustard. It was extremely spicy. But it was good."
"Delicious, filling, well priced, locally sourced. There's a reason this place is slammed around lunch time! Order ahead and go pick up, no issues there. Interior is bright and clean, with a separate area for picking up to-go orders."
"I hope I can share the picture I took of the fish salad delivered by uber eats from this restaurant for $17 today with the owner to find out what was the problem.  That's all the explanation needed... sadly. If I can't post pic, well, in ‚Ä¶"
