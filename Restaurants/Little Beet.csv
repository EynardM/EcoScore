review
"Nice place with healthy food. The service was good and there are lots of place to sit. The portions are small relatively, but prices are low."
We had lunch there on a Sunday at 3 pm . The place wasn‚Äôt busy at this time. I had a quinoa and salmon plate. It looked healthy. The booth was comfortable. The staff was super nice. The place looked nice. I will come back for my lunch break.
Healthy and GF (celiac safe) food. You can find a Little beet in many neighborhoods in Manhattan. Loved the make your own bowl option.
"The food was good, what was most impressive was the assembly line and the team work, very well coordinated! I said my choices to the first person and didn't have to repeat, my bowl was assembled with the right ingredients! Very impressive, ‚Ä¶"
The food is hit or miss. I‚Äôve been in a few times which usually goes better than delivery. Be careful if you order via Uber Eats. Little Beet will not honor (and don‚Äôt care about) your order. The rice in the basmati bowl is very al dente. ‚Ä¶
Food allergy friendly place with delicious and relatively healthy food at a reasonable price. No wonder why this place has many customers and surrounding establishments don‚Äôt. I recommend giving them a try!
"Damn, that hit the spot! Chef choices were great! Got the butternut squash with chicken üòç‚Ä¶ so freaking good! The place is cute and even though I ordered ahead of my arrival the line was not long! I‚Äôm still eating this meal while I‚Äôm writing this and feel my body fueling up! üôèüèΩü§ç‚ú® ‚Ä¶"
"Really amazing GF options! I made my own plate with salmon, sweet potatoes, and rainbow carrots. The carrots were a little too roasted but that happens! Great flavor!"
"Gluten free haven! I was blown away by the fresh flavors and number of options.
Creamy turmeric dressing was my fav. Coupled with beet and lentils and sweet potatoes and the toasted nuts. ‚Ä¶"
"Considering how bad the butternut squash soup was, and that they threw it all out after I made them aware, one might think they'd offer me a replacement or refund. My review ends here... ‚Ä¶"
