review
"stop by here whenever I'm at the fashion district. this place has been here for so many years and their sandwiches and coffee, juice has always been reliably good. my favorite is their tuna sandwich and fresh apple juice. very fresh tasting coffee too-"
Sandwiches are good. The Korean owner is very friendly. There is plenty of outdoor seating.  The cafe itself is small. It is located directly in front of the escalators on the 2nd floor.
Most refreshing spot downtown for sure
Great Smothies!!
