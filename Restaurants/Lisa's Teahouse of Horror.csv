review
Great food choices.  There are a ton of places in here. Tons of seating too. If you want a quick bite to eat or just want some air conditioning you could stop here. â€¦
The salad we got was inedible. The croutons were soggy and the lettuce was severely wilted and we paid almost $30 for two salads. Not organized as far as what line to get in.
This area is laid out like a food court. The ordering process could be organized better and there's almost never anywhere to sit indoors
