"Always perfect! Food and service are consistently amazing. Top, the waiter is super friendly and welcoming everytime. It's great knowing I can always count on a great meal with a smile at Green Leaves. Thank you Top and management üôè. Highly recommended this place for vegans and beyond. ‚Ä¶"
Wonderful Vegan Spot in Los Feliz area of LA. We were in the area and took a chance as we were looking for a healthy vegan meal.  Cute vibes and great listening music. They have lots of choices so it was hard to decide what to order. ‚Ä¶

"I went here for a Saturday morning meal, to get out of the house and get some sunshine. I got country noodles and my partner got lentil soup because his stomach wasn't feeling great. We were bothe xtremely satisfied with price and service. The food felt like someone in my family had cooked a hearty meal"
"Nice and pleasant place. Kind staff. The pancakes with ""chicken"" were very tasty. :)"
"1st  Time trying Green Leaves,  I'm so happy that I got the vegetable Dinner Stir Fry with steamed chicken not tofu and on the side I wanted to try the fried soy chicken. Which was everything I'd hope for!!! Overall, it was delicious I cannot wait to go back!!!"
